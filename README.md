# upper_bound-lower_bound

upper_bound() is a standard library function in C++ defined in the header .
It returns an iterator(for vector , ptr for array) pointing to the first element in the range [first, last] that is greater than value, or last if no such element is found. 
The elements in the range shall already be sorted or at least partitioned with respect to val.
